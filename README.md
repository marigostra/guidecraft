# GuideCraft

GuideCraft is an accessibility toolkit for the blind with new kind of inter-process communication (IPC).
since all apps the user is working with are located in different processes,
the implementation of assistive technologies requires especially effective IPC tools.
The information transmitted from apps to a gathering tool goes through a special mechanism, currently mostly D-Bus.
D-Bus complies a client-server architecture in which the daemon receives information from a source and sequentially sends it over network connections.
